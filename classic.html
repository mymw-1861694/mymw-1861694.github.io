					<p>The Classic Range comprises of a multitude of aesthetically pleasing coffins that are not only pleasing to the eye, but also to the environment. It will definitely bring peace to the soul, knowing that you are still doing your part to save our world even from the grave. Built to slowly release nutrients to the surrounding soil, the alkaline shell will mix with your acidic compounds to fully enrich and nurture the plants cradling your grave. The porous cover will also allow the organisms that facilitate decomposition to do their job without the coffin caving in. The effect? A slow "fading" of you and your final resting place, leaving behind a thriving forest of plants and animals that started due to your contribution to the ecosystem. </p>
					<p>Plant-safe dyes can also be included to color the surrounding flowers when it rains. Create your own rainbow bubble that pleases the eyes and brightens up the surroundings. If not, you can also choose to include a music system that is triggered when a plant directly grows from you. It can last for one month before it also decomposes. A myriad of marvels can be created from the technology available to us today to achieve any desired effect you wish. Our company takes it a step futher to ensure that these also remain eco-friendly and don't leave a harmful effect on the organisms living there. </p>
